## Crop Prediction:
A web-based application powered by machine learning to recommend crop variety and also predict crop yeild.

The system aims to help farmers to cultivate proper crop for better yield production based on predictive analysis of the market also. 

For accurate prediction we use multiple features to train our model some of them being:
* soil composition
* rainfall
* nutrient contents of the soil
* previously planted crops 
* temperature
* return of investment
* time of the year(month)
* irrigation 

The USP of our project is that not only does it give prediction it also does future simulation for you. It compares the accuracy obtained by different network learning techniques and the most accurate result will be delivered to the end user.

Our website is also very user friendly in the means of collecting the input; it has the following features:-
* it supports contact in multiple languages; i.e users can choose which language they are more comfortable in to ensure farmers are able to communicate to the best of their abilities 
* user then has to input values which will then be fed to the model for accurate prediction 
* the results will be displayed back to the user after prediction 

## Getting Started:
Our website is also very user friendly in the means of collecting the input; it has the following features:
* it supports contact in multiple languages; i.e users can choose which language they are more comfortable in to ensure farmers are able to communicate to the best of their abilities 
* user then has to input values which will then be fed to the model for accurate prediction 
* the results will be displayed back to the user after prediction 

## Prerequisites:
Device should support any one of the popular browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE9, and Opera)

## Features:
* accurate prediction model 
* no language barriers 
* crop cycle simulation 

## Specifications:
* coded in Python 3.11.2.
* uses Flask 
* frontend codes have html,css,js. 
 
## Data Understanding:
Crop Data
The data refers to district wise, crop wise, season wise and year wise data on crop covered area and production. The data is being used to study and analyse crop production, production contribution to district/State/country, Agro-climatic zone wise performance, and high yield production order for crops, crop growing pattern and diversification.
